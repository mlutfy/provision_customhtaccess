Allows to include custom htaccess directives in your site vhost.
Create a file called sites/example.org/htaccess-custom and run provision-verify on the site.

IMPORTANT: You must fully trust users who can modify this file. This is
equivalent to allowing them to modify your global Apache configuration.
A user could declare new vhosts, add/override options, etc.
